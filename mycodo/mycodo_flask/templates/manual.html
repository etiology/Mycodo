    <h2>Relay Usage Settings</h2>

    <p>In order to calculate accurate <a href="/usage">relay usage statistics</a>, a few characteristics of your electrical system needs to be know. These variables should describe the characteristics of the electrical system being used by the relays to operate electrical devices.

		<h1>Controllers</h1>

    <p>Controllers are essentially modules that can be used to perform functions or communicate with other parts of Mycodo. Each controller performs a specific task or group of related tasks. There are also Controller Functions, which are larger functions of a controller or controllers and have been given their own sections.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="sensors"></a>
		<h2>Sensors</h2>

    <p>Sensors measure environmental conditions, which will be stored in an influx database. This database will provide recent measurement for <a href="/help#conditional-statements">Conditional Statements</a> or <a href="/help#pid">PID Controllers</a> to operate from, among other uses.</p>

    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Activate</dt>

      <dt>Location</dt>
      <dd>Depending on what sensor is being used, you will need to either select a serial number (DS18B20 temperature sensor), a GPIO pin (in the case of sensors read by a GPIO), or an I<sup>2</sup>C address. and channel if using the TCA9548A I<sup>2</sup>C multiplexer.</dd>
      <dt>I<sup>2</sup>C Bus</dt>
      <dd>The bus to be used to communicate with the I<sup>2</sup>C address. If you're using an I<sup>2</sup>C multiplexer that provides multiple buses, this allows you to select which bus the sensor is connected to.</dd>
      <dt>Period</dt>
      <dd>After the sensor is successfully read and a database entry is made, this is the duration of time waited until the sensor is measured again.</dd>
      <dt>Pre Relay</dt>
      <dd>If you require a relay to be activated before a measurement is made (for instance, if you have a pump that extracts air to a chamber where the sensor resides), this is the relay number that will be activated. The relay will be activated for a duration defined by the Pre Duration, then once the relay turns off, a measurement by the sensor is made.</dd>
      <dt>Pre Relay Duration</dt>
      <dd>This is the duration of time that the Pre Relay runs for before the sensor measurement is obtained.</dd>
      <dt>Edge</dt>
      <dd>Edge sensors only: Select whether the Rising or Falling (or both) edges of a changing voltage are detected. A number of devices to do this when in-line with a circuit supplying a 3.3-volt input signal to a GPIO, such as simple mechanical switch, a button, a magnet (reed/hall) sensor, a PIR motion detector, and more.</dd>
      <dt>Bounce Time (ms)</dt>
      <dd>Edge sensors only: This is the number of milliseconds to bounce the input signal. This is commonly called <a target="_blank" href="http://kylegabriel.com/projects/2016/02/morse-code-translator.html#debouncing">debouncing a signal</a>, and may be necessary if using a mechanical circuit.</dd>
      <dt>Reset Period</dt>
      <dd>Edge sensors only: This is the period of time after an edge detection that another edge will not be recorded. This enables devices such as PIR motion sensors that may stay activated for longer periods of time.</dd>

      <dd>Analog-to-digital converter only: This is the channel to obtain the voltage measurement from the ADC.</dd>
      <dt>Gain</dt>
      <dd>Analog-to-digital converter only: set the gain when acquiring the measurement.</dd>
      <dt>Volts Min</dt>
      <dd>Analog-to-digital converter only: What is the minimum voltage to use when scaling to produce the unit value for the database. For instance, if your ADC is not expected to measure below 0.2 volts for your particular circuit, set this to "0.2".</dd>
      <dt>Volts Max</dt>
      <dd>Analog-to-digital converter only: This is similar to the Min option above, however it is setting the ceiling to the voltage range.</dd>
      <dt>Units Min</dt>
      <dd>Analog-to-digital converter only: This value will be the lower value of a range that will use the Min and Max Voltages, above, to produce a unit output. For instance, if your voltage range is 0.0 - 1.0 volts, and the unit range is 1 - 60, and a voltage of 0.5 is measured, in addition to 0.5 being stored in the database, 30 will be stored as well. This enables creating calibrated scales to use with your particular circuit.</dd>

		<h3>Sensor Verification</h3>

    <p>Sensor verification was introduced in an earlier version and was broken when the system moved to its new software framework. It was a great feature, and it's planned to be integrated into the latest version.</p>

		<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">This allows the verification of a sensor's measurement with another sensor's measurement. This feature is best utilized when you have two sensors in the same location (ideally as close as possible). One sensor (host) should be set up to use the other sensor (slave) to verify. The host sensor should be used to operate the PID, as one feature of the verification is the ability to disable the PID if the difference between measurements is not within the range specified.</p>

		<dl class="dl-horizontal" style="text-decoration: line-through;">
      <dt>GPIO</dt>
      <dd>This is the sensor that will be used to verify the sensor measurement. The sensor will be read directly after the first sensor's measurement to verify whether the sensors have similar measurements.</dd>
      <dt>Difference</dt>
      <dd>This is the maximum measured measurement difference between the two sensors before an action is triggered (either notify by email or prevent PID from operating; more below).</dd>
      <dt>Notification</dt>
      <dd>If the measurements of the two sensors differ by more than the set <i>Difference</i>, an email will be sent to the address in the <i>Notification</i> field.</dd>

		<a class="anchor" name="relays"></a>
		<h2>Relays</h2>

		<p>Relays are electromechanical or solid-state devices that enable a small voltage signal (such as from a microprocessor) to activate a much larger voltage, without exposing the low -voltage system to the dangers of the higher voltage.</p>

		<p>Relays must be properly set up before PID regulation can be achieved. Add and configure relays in the Sensor tab. Set the "GPIO Pin" to the BCM GPIO number of each pin that activates each relay. <i>On Trigger</i> should be set to the signal that activates the relay (closes the relay circuit). If your relay activates when the potential across the coil is 0-volts, set <i>On Trigger</i> to "Low", otherwise if your relay activates when the potential across the coil is 5-volts, set it to "High".</p>

    <dl class="dl-horizontal">

      <dd>This is the GPIO that will be the signal to the relay.</dd>
      <dt>Current Draw (amps)</dt>
      <dd>The is the amount of current the device powered by the relay draws. Note: this value should be calculated based on the voltage set in the <a href="#settings-relay-usage">Relay Usage Settings</a>.</dd>
      <dt>On Trigger</dt>
      <dd>This is the state of the GPIO to signal the relay to turn the device on. HIGH will send a 3.3-volt signal and LOW will send a 0-volt signal. If you relay completes the circuit (and the device powers on) when a 3.3-volt signal is sent, then set this to HIGH. If the device powers when a 0-volt signal is sent, set this to LOW.</dd>
      <dt>Start State</dt>
      <dd>This specifies whether the relay should be ON or OFF when mycodo initially starts.</dd>
      <dt>Seconds to turn On</dt>
      <dd>This is a way to turn a relay on for a specific duration of time. This can be useful for testing the relays and powered devices or the measured effects a device may have on an environmental condition.</dd>

    <a class="anchor" name="pid"></a>
		<h2>PID Regulation</h2>

    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller</a> is a control loop feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling systems. It efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the temperature, to a desired state and maintains it there with little overshoot and oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the setpoint quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with little oscillation.</p>

    <p>PID settings may be changed while the PID is activated and the new settings will take effect immediately. If settings are changed while the controller is paused, the values will be used once the controller resumes operation.</p>

		<dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Activate/Deactivate</dt>
      <dd>Turn a particular PID controller on or off.</dd>

		<a class="anchor" name="conditional-statements"></a>
		<h2>Conditional Statements</h2>

		<p>A conditional statement is a way to perform certain actions based on whether a condition is true. Conditional statements can be created for both relays and sensors. Possible conditional statements include:</p>

		<ul>
      <li>If Relay #1 turns ON, turn Relay #3 ON</li>
      <li>If Relay #1 turns ON, turn Relay #4 ON for 40 seconds and notify critical-issue@domain.com</li>
      <li>If Relay #4 turns ON for 21 seconds, turn Relay #5 ON for 50 seconds</li>
      <li>If Relay #4 turns ON for 20 seconds, turn Relay #1 OFF</li>
      <li>If Humidity is Greater Than 80%, turn Relay #4 ON for 40 seconds</li>
      <li>If Humidity if Less Than 50%, turn Relay #1 ON for 21 seconds, execute '/usr/local/bin/myscript.sh', and notify email@domain.com</li>
      <li>If Temperature if Greater Than 35 C, deactivate PID #1</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Before activating any conditional statements or PID controllers, it's advised to thoroughly explore all possible scenarios and plan a configuration that eliminates conflicts. Then, trial run your configuration before connecting devices to the relays. Some devices or relays may respond atypically or fail when switched on and off in rapid succession. Therefore, avoid creating an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_%28computing%29#Infinite_loops" target="_blank">infinite loop</a> with conditional statements.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="methods"></a>
		<h2>Methods</h2>

    <p>Methods allow different types of setpoint tracking in PID controllers. Normally, a PID controller will regulate an environmental condition to a specific setpoint. If you would like the setpoint to change over time, this is called setpoint tracking. Setpoint tracking is useful for applications such as reflow ovens, thermal cyclers (DNA replication), mimicking natural daily cycles, and more.</p>

    <h3>Universal Options</h3>

    <p>These options are shared with several method types.</p>

    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Start Time/Date</dt>
      <dd>This is the start time of a range of time.</dd>
      <dt>End Time/Date</dt>
      <dd>This is the end time of a range of time.</dd>
      <dt>Start Setpoint</dt>
      <dd>This is the start setpoint of a range of setpoints.</dd>
      <dt>End Setpoint</dt>
      <dd>This is the end setpoint of a range of setpoints.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Specific Method Options</h3>

    <h4>Time/Date Method</h4>

    <p>A time/date method allows a specific time/date span to dictate the setpoint. This is useful for long-running methods, that may take place over the period of days, weeks, or months.</p>

    <h4>Duration Method</h4>

    <p>A duration method allows a specific durations of time to dictate the setpoint. This is useful for when short periods of time are required in a method, such as those that take place over the course of a few minutes or hours. Each duration will stack on the previous duration, meaning a newly-added start setpoint will begin from the previous entry's end setpoint.</p>

    <h4>Daily (Time-Based) Method</h4>

    <p>The daily time-based method is similar to the time/date method, however it will repeat every day. Therefore, it is essential that only the span of one day be set in this method. Begin with the start time at 00:00:00 and end at 23:59:59 (or 00:00:00, which would be 24 hours from the start). The start time must be equal or greater than the previous end time.</p>

    <h4>Daily (Sine Wave) Method</h4>

    <p>The daily sine wave method defines the setpoint over the day based on a sinusoidal wave. The sine wave is defined by y = [A * sin(B * x + C)] + D, where A is amplitude, B is frequency, C is the angle shift, and D is the y-axis shift. This method will repeat daily.</p>

    <h4>Daily (Bezier Curve) Method</h4>

    <p>A daily Bezier curve method define the setpoint over the day based on a cubic Bezier curve. If unfamiliar with a Bezier curve, it is recommended you use the <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cahqdxeshd">graphical Bezier curve generator</a> and use the 8 variables it creates for 4 points (each a set of x and y). The x-axis start (x3) and end (x0) will be automatically stretched or skewed to fit within a 24-hour period and this method will repeat daily.</p>

		<h2>PID Tuning</h2>

		<a class="anchor" name="pid-control-theory"></a>
		<h3>PID Control Theory</h3>

		<p>The PID controller is the most common regulatory controller found in industrial settings, for it"s ability to handle both simple and complex regulation. The PID controller has three paths, the proportional, integral, and derivative.</p>

		<p>The <b>P</b>roportional takes the error and multiplies it by the constant K<sub>p</sub>, to yield an output value. When the error is large, there will be a large proportional output.</p>

		<p>The <b>I</b>ntegral takes the error and multiplies it by K<sub>i</sub>, then integrates it (K<sub>i</sub> · 1/s). As the error changes over time, the integral will continually sum it and multiply it by the constant K<sub>i</sub>. The integral is used to remove perpetual error in the control system. If using K<sub>p</sub> alone produces an output that produces a perpetual error (i.e. if the sensor measurement never reaches the Set Point), the integral will increase the output until the error decreases and the Set Point is reached.</p>

		<p>The <b>D</b>erivative multiplies the error by K<sub>d</sub>, then differentiates it (K<sub>d</sub> · s). When the error rate changes over time, the output signal will change. The faster the change in error, the larger the derivative path becomes, decreasing the output rate of change. This has the effect of dampening overshoot and undershoot (oscillation) of the Set Point.</p>

    <hr>

		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller" target="_blank"><img src="/static/img/PIDAnimation.gif"></a></p>

		<p>Using temperature as an example, the Process Variable (PV) is the measured temperature, the Setpoint (SP) is the desired temperature, and the Error (e) is the distance between the measured temperature and the desired temperature (indicating if the actual temperature is too hot or too cold and to what degree). The error is manipulated by each of the three PID components, producing an output, called the Manipulated Variable (MV) or Control Variable (CV). To allow control of how much each path contributes to the output value, each path is multiplied by a gain (represented by <i>K<sub>P</sub></i>, <i>K<sub>I</sub></i>, and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i>). By adjusting the gains, the sensitivity of the system to each path is affected. When all three paths are summed, the PID output is produced. If a gain is set to 0, that path does not contribute to the output and that path is essentially turned off.</p>

		<p>The output can be used a number of ways, however this controller was designed to use the output to affect the measured value (PV). This feedback loop, with a <i>properly tuned</i> PID controller, can achieve a set point in a short period of time, maintain regulation with little oscillation, and respond quickly to disturbance.</p>

		<p>Therefor, if one would be regulating temperature, the sensor would be a temperature sensor and the feedback device(s) would be able to heat and cool. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the output value would be positive and a heater would activate. The temperature would rise toward the desired temperature, causing the error to decrease and a lower output to be produced. This feedback loop would continue until the error reaches 0 (at which point the output would be 0). If the temperature continues to rise past the Set Point (this is may be acceptable, depending on the degree), the PID would produce a negative output, which could be used by the cooling device to bring the temperature back down, to reduce the error. If the temperature would normally lower without the aid of a cooling device, then the system can be simplified by omitting a cooler and allowing it to lower on its own.</p>

		<p>Implementing a controller that effectively utilizes <i>K<sub>P</sub></i>, <i>K<sub>I</sub></i>, and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> can be challenging. Furthermore, it is often unnecessary. For instance, the <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> can be set to 0, effectively turning them off and producing the very popular and simple P controller. Also popular is the PI controller. It is recommended to start with only <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> activated, then experiment with <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>I</sub></i>, before finally using all three. Because systems will vary (e.g. airspace volume, degree of insulation, and the degree of impact from the connected device, etc.), each path will need to be adjusted through experimentation to produce an effective output.</p>

		<a class="anchor" name="quick-set-up-examples"></a>
		<h3>Quick Set-up Examples</h3>

		<p>These example setups are meant to illustrate how to configure regulation in particular directions, and not to achieve ideal values to configure your <i>K<sub>P</sub></i>, <i>K<sub>I</sub></i>, and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> gains. There are a number of online resources that discuss techniques and methods that have been developed to determine ideal PID values (such as <a href="http://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/167/what-are-good-strategies-for-tuning-pid-loops" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://innovativecontrols.com/blog/basics-tuning-pid-loops" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://hennulat.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/pid-loop-tuning-101/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://eas.uccs.edu/wang/ECE4330F12/PID-without-a-PhD.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2558.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) and since there are no universal values that will work for every system, it is recommended to conduct your own research to understand the variables and essential to conduct your own experiments to effectively implement them.</p>

		<p>Provided merely as an example of the variance of PID values, one of my setups had temperature PID values (up regulation) of <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> = 30, <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> = 1.0, and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> = 0.5, and humidity PID values (up regulation) of <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> = 1.0, <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> = 0.2, and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> = 0.5. Furthermore, these values may not have been optimal but they worked well for the conditions of my environmental chamber.</p>

		<a class="anchor" name="exact-temperature-regulation"></a>
		<h3>Exact Temperature Regulation</h3>

		<p>This will set up the system to raise and lower the temperature to a certain level with two regulatory devices (one that heats and one that cools).</p>

		<p>Add a sensor, then save the proper device and pin/address for each sensor and activate the sensor.</p>

		<p>Add two relays, then save each GPIO and On Trigger state.</p>

		<p>Add a PID, then select the newly-created sensor. Change <i>Setpoint</i> to the desired temperature, <i>Regulate Direction</i> to "Both". Set <i>Raise Relay</i> to the relay attached to the heating device and the <i>Lower Relay</i> to the relay attached to the cooling device.</p>

		<p>Set <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> = 1, <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> = 0, and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> = 0, then activate the PID.</p>

		<p>If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the heater should activate at some interval determined by the PID controller until the temperature rises to the set point. If the temperature goes higher than the Set Point (or Set Point + Buffer), the cooling device will activate until the temperature returns to the set point. If the temperature is not reaching the Set Point after a reasonable amount of time, increase the <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> value and see how that affects the system. Experiment with different configurations involving only <i>Read Interval</i> and <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> to achieve a good regulation. Avoid changing the <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> from 0 until a working regulation is achieved with <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> alone.</p>

		<p>View graphs in the 6 to 12 hour time span to identify how well the temperature is regulated to the Setpoint. What is meant by well-regulated will vary, depending on your specific application and tolerances. Most applications of a PID controller would like to see the proper temperature attained within a reasonable amount of time and with little oscillation around the Setpoint.</p>

		<p>Once regulation is achieved, experiment by reducing <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> slightly (~25%) and increasing <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> by a low amount to start, such as 0.1 (or lower, 0.01), then start the PID and observe how well the controller regulates. Slowly increase <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> until regulation becomes both quick and with little oscillation. At this point, you should be fairly familiar with experimenting with the system and the <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> value can be experimented with once both <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> have been tuned.</p>

		<a class="anchor" name="high-temperature-regulation"></a>
		<h3>High Temperature Regulation</h3>

		<p>Often the system can be simplified if two-way regulation is not needed. For instance, if cooling is unnecessary, this can be removed from the system and only up-regulation can be used.</p>

		<p>Use the same configuration as the <a href="#exact-temperature-regulation">Exact Temperature Regulation</a> example, except change <i>Regulate Direction</i> to "Raise" and do not touch the "Down Relay" section.</p>

    <h3>Luminosity Sensors</h3>

    <a class="anchor" name="TSL2561"></a>
    <h4>TSL2561</h4>

    <p>The TSL2561 SparkFun Luminosity Sensor Breakout is a sophisticated light sensor which has a flat response across most of the visible spectrum. Unlike simpler sensors, the TSL2561 measures both infrared and visible light to better approximate the response of the human eye. And because the TSL2561 is an integrating sensor (it soaks up light for a predetermined amount of time), it is capable of measuring both small and large amounts of light by changing the integration time.</p>

    <p>
    Specifications:
    <br>Light range: 0.1 - 40k+ Lux
    <br>Vin: 3V and a low supply
    <br>Max current: 0.6mA.
